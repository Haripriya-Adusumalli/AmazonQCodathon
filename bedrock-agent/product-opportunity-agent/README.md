# Product Opportunity Recommendation System

A comprehensive AI-powered system that identifies high-potential product opportunities using DCC (Demand + Competition + Capability) analysis.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Orchestrator Agent** - Main coordinator that routes queries and merges insights
2. **Domain Agents** - Specialized agents for different analysis areas:
   - MarketDemand Agent - Google Trends, NewsAPI, Reddit analysis
   - CompetitorScan Agent - Amazon/eBay product analysis
   - CapabilityMatch Agent - Internal readiness assessment via Q Business
   - PricingIntel Agent - Review mining and pain-point analysis
   - FeatureGap Agent - Differentiation strategy recommendations

### üìä DCC Scoring Model

For each product opportunity:

```
DCC Score = (Demand √ó 0.45) + ((100 - Competition) √ó 0.30) + (Capability √ó 0.25)
```

- **Demand Score (0-100)**: Market interest, trends, momentum
- **Competition Score (0-100)**: Market saturation (lower = better opportunity)  
- **Capability Score (0-100)**: Internal readiness to execute

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### 1. Deploy the Agent
```bash
cd bedrock-agent/product-opportunity-agent
python simple-deploy.py
```

### 2. Update React Configuration
Copy the agent ID and alias ID from the deployment output to `src/aws-config.js`:

```javascript
export const productOpportunityConfig = {
  agentId: 'YOUR_AGENT_ID',
  aliasId: 'YOUR_ALIAS_ID', 
  region: 'us-east-1'
};
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
npm start
```

## üí° Usage Examples

Try these queries in the Product Opportunity Analyzer:

- "Analyze smart water bottle opportunity in India"
- "What's the potential for eco-friendly phone cases?"
- "Should we launch a fitness tracking app for seniors?"
- "Evaluate the market for AI-powered study tools"

## üîß Advanced Setup (Full System)

For production deployment with all domain agents and APIs:

1. **Set up API Keys**:
   - Google Trends API
   - NewsAPI key
   - Reddit API credentials
   - Amazon Product Advertising API

2. **Deploy Lambda Functions**:
   ```bash
   python deploy-product-agents.py
   ```

3. **Configure Q Business Integration** for internal capability analysis
